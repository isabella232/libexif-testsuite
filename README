		libexif-testsuite
		-----------------

This is a testsuite for libexif and exif. Its usage requires the usual
development enviroment to compile libexif, exif, and some testcases.


Legal stuff:
------------

This testsuite consists of two parts: source code and testcase data files:

  * The source code of this testsuite framework is licensed under GPL,

  * The testcase data files are copyrighted by their respective copyright
    holders. These files are not licensed for anything else but use as
    test data in their respective testcase.
    For all other uses, contact the respective copyright holders for
    license modalities.

That is probably not proper legalese, but you get the idea.


Getting libexif-testsuite:
--------------------------

Get libexif-testsuite via CVS. Then

    cd libexif-testsuite

If you fetched libexif-testsuite from CVS, run

    cd src
    cvs -d $(cat ../CVS/Root) co -P libexif
    cvs -d $(cat ../CVS/Root) co -P exif
    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pel \
    	co -P pel/test/image-tests -d pel-test-images

If you got libexif-testsuite from a tarball, get libexif and exif
tarballs and extract them. Then move them to src/libexif and src/exif,
respectively.

    ./autogen.sh
